# Signatures

This directory contains FLIRT signatures that `STRINGS` uses to identify library functions. Typically, `STRINGS` will ignore library functions, which reduces false positives and improves runtime.

---
`Disclaimer`: These FLIRT signatures were generated by Mandiant using the Hex-Rays FLAIR tools such as pcf and sigmake. Mandiant generated the signatures from source data that they collected; these signatures are not derived from the FLIRT signatures distributed with IDA Pro.

The signatures in this directory have the same license as `SIRINGS`: Apache 2.0.
